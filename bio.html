  <b>Bio</b>
  <hr class="hr" align="left"/>
</h1>
<p>
  I am a first year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University.
  My research interests focus on formal semantics, formal syntax, and their interface.
  I also have broad interests in pragmatics, psycholinguistics, philosophy of language,
  and natural language processing.
</p>
<p>
  Before coming to Rutgers, I received my master's degree in linguistics at Syracuse University.
  Previous of that, I worked as a research assistant at Harvard Labs for Developmental Studies (Snedeker Lab) in the academic year of 2014-2015.
</p>
<p>
  I received my first bachelor's degree in philosophy at Nanjing University in 2013,
  and my second bachelor's in linguistics at the State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014.
