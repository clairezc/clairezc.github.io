    In semantics, I work on the contrasts between typical XPs and <i>wh</i>-XPs when they interact with the Mandarin particle <i>dou</i>,
    when it functions as a quantifier/distributor and a scalar marker.
    I propose that the contrasts described in my paper is due to the contradiction between disjunction and the universal quantification requirement of <i>dou</i>.

    In syntax, I argue for the universal DP-hypothesis by
    claiming that Mandarin projects a DP, even though it is a language without articles.
    I am also looking into the nature of verbal nouns in Korean.

    In psycholinguistics, I worked with Ph.D. student Laine Stanahan in Snedeker Lab,
    helping check the experimental files of a previous study about processing scalar implicatures under working memory load for counterbalancing.
    I also assisted in designing and producing the stimuli for an ongoing study about scalar implicatures.

    Other research projects I have worked on include exploring the role of L2 in L3 acquisition.
