  <b>Bio</b>
  <hr/>
</p>
<p>
  I am a first year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University.
  My research interests focus on formal semantics, formal syntax, and their interface.
  I also have broad interests in pragmatics, psycholinguistics, philosophy of language,
  and natural language processing.
</p>
<p>
  Before coming to Rutgers, I received my master's degree in linguistics at Syracuse University.
  Previous of that, I worked as a research assistant at Harvard Labs for Developmental Studies (Snedeker Lab) in the academic year of 2014-2015.
</p>
<p>
  I received my first bachelor's degree in philosophy at Nanjing University in 2013,
  and my second bachelor's in linguistics at the State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In semantics, I work on the contrasts between typical XPs and wh-XPs when they interact with the Mandarin particle <i>dou</i>,
    when it functions as a quantifier/distributor and a scalar marker.
    I propose that the contrasts described in my paper is due to the contradiction between disjunction and the universal quantification requirement of <i>dou</i>.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    In syntax, I argue for the universal DP-hypothesis by
    claiming that Mandarin projects a DP, even though it is a language without articles.
    I am also looking into the nature of verbal nouns in Korean.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    In psycholinguistics, I worked with Ph.D. student Laine Stanahan in Snedeker Lab,
    helping check the experimental files of a previous study about processing scalar implicatures under working memory load for counterbalancing.
    I also assisted in designing and producing the stimuli for an ongoing study about scalar implicatures.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    Other research projects I have worked on include exploring the role of L2 in L3 acquisition.
